**Limitations**

* This is a first version of our work in generating Indian Scripts limited to only devanagari for now.

* Considering limited fonts available for Indian scripts with very few variations, our network fails for some fonts.

* Input size of English as well as Devanagari glyphs do make a significant change in the generated image quality and the overall style capturing.

* We have processed the data based on most corner cases, so as to make the Inputs images as size consistent as possible but some exception cases lead to bad generations sometimes.
