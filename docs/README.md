# Fonts Generation for Indic Scripts

This is just a template for the project.  
You need to edit all the files in it (including this README),  
feel free to structure it however you want and  
link it all in the `sidebar.md` file.

Finally, you can enable the GitHub pages for this project by choosing to render master branch's `docs/` folder.  
(It may take sometime to get fully published)

<hr/>

# To run this locally
