**Limitations**

1. This is a first version of our work in generating Indian Scripts limited to only devanagari for now.

2. Considering limited fonts available for Indian scripts with very few variations, our network fails for some fonts.

3. Input size of English as well as Devanagari glyphs do make a significant change in the generated image quality and the overall style capturing.

4. We have processed the data based on most corner cases, so as to make the Inputs images as size consistent as possible but some exception cases lead to bad generations sometimes.
